**Title:** Create and follow a coding pattern for Laravel applications

**Description:**

In order to make Laravel applications more maintainable, scalable, and testable, it is important to follow a consistent coding pattern. This issue proposes a simple coding pattern that can be used as a starting point for any Laravel application.

**Proposed coding pattern:**

1. **Route:** The route should define the endpoint and the controller that should be called when the route is hit.
2. **Controller:** The controller should be responsible for handling the incoming request, validating the request data, and calling the appropriate service class.
3. **Request validation:** The controller should validate the request data using Laravel's built-in validation features.
4. **Validated data from controller to service class:** The controller should pass the validated request data to the service class.
5. **Array arranging generating and other tasks:** The service class should be responsible for performing any necessary business logic on the data, such as arranging and generating arrays.
6. **Data from service to repository for database operation:** The service class should pass the data to the repository class for database operations.

**Benefits:**

Following this coding pattern will provide a number of benefits, including:

* Increased maintainability: The code will be easier to understand and maintain, as it will follow a consistent pattern.
* Increased scalability: The code will be more scalable, as the different layers of the application can be easily separated and scaled independently.
* Increased testability: The code will be more testable, as the different layers of the application can be easily unit-tested and integration tested.

**Implementation:**

This coding pattern can be implemented by creating separate directories for the routes, controllers, service classes, and repository classes. The routes should be placed in the `app/Http/routes` directory, the controllers should be placed in the `app/Http/Controllers` directory, the service classes should be placed in the `app/Services` directory, and the repository classes should be placed in the `app/Repositories` directory.

Once the directories have been created, the code for each layer of the application can be written according to the proposed coding pattern.

**Example:**

Here is an example of a simple controller that implements the proposed coding pattern:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Requests\StoreUserRequest;
use App\Services\UserService;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function store(StoreUserRequest $request, UserService $userService)
    {
        // Validate the request data.
        $request->validate();

        // Get the validated request data.
        $validatedData = $request->validated();

        // Call the UserService class to store the user.
        $userService->storeUser($validatedData);

        // Return a successful response.
        return response()->json(['message' => 'User stored successfully'], 201);
    }
}
```

This controller simply validates the request data and calls the UserService class to perform the necessary business logic. The UserService class would then be responsible for performing any additional business logic on the data, such as arranging and generating arrays, and passing the data to the UserRepository class for database operations.

**Conclusion:**

Following the proposed coding pattern will help to make Laravel applications more maintainable, scalable, and testable. This coding pattern is just a starting point, and it can be customized to meet the specific needs of each application.
